## Project Overview
This project will build an automated pipeline that receives new data from MovieLens rating data, Wikipedia data, and Kaggle metadata as part of the Amazing Prime Hackathon. After that, it inserts the data into an existing PostgreSQL database and makes the necessary modifications.
